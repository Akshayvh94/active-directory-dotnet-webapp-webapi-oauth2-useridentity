WebApp-WebAPI-OAuth2-UserIdentity-DotNet
========================================

In the sample, an existing web app with its own way of signing in users adds the ability to call an Azure AD protected web API, in this case the Graph API.  This sample uses the OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant with confidential client and the Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) to obtain access tokens for the web app to call the Graph API with the user's identity.
